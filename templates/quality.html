	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>I evaluated the data based on the following metrics:</p>
   <b>Is the data coherent?</b>
   <ul>
   <li>Does it make sense relative to itself?</li>
   <li>Does it match your expectations?</li>
   <li>Is the data is distributed across its possible values in a way that makes sense?</li>
   </ul>

<b>Is your data correct?</b>
<ul><li>Is there a source of bias?</li>
<li>Are there measurement errors?</li>
<li>Are errors random or do they introduce you to bias?</li>
<li>Are errors more likely in some variables than others?</li>
<li>Is there a specific type of error you expect?</li></ul>

<b>Is the data accountable?</b>
<ul><li>Do you understand the provenance of the data?</li>
<li>Have you protected any end users or the people who could be traced?</li>
<li>Can you back up your claims about the data?</li>
<li>Do you have the original data as well as any modifications?</li>
<li>Is the data complete? If not, what is missing, and what concerns does it raise?</li>
<li>Does the data you have match the questions you want answered? Is there any missing data? Is there any reporting errors?</li></ul>

	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>The original dataset was <b>not complete</b>. The dataset spanned from 1980 to 2017, but only 
	the period between 1990 and 2015 had data for a sizeable fraction of the world's countries. The 
	rest of the dataset was mostly empty. The years that were missing depleted the effectiveness 
	of the dataset in depicting trends over time.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>The dataset feels largely <b>coherent</b>. The forest cover is a percentage value, 
        and it stays between 0 and 99, which is as expected. The dataset matches my expectations
        about how forest cover has changed over time. For example, the dataset shows that forest cover in Brazil, 
        where rainforests are being cut down, has decreased between 1995 and 2015.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>The data seems <b>correct</b> for the most part, but some numbers seem a little suspect. For example, 
	the dataset shows that forest cover in China and India has increased between 1990 and 2015. This seems surprising
	to me, because I know that both countries are actively expanding their urban and agricultural territories. Looking at those 
	statistics makes me question exactly how 'forest cover' is defined by the dataset. There isn't enough clarity about this.</p>
